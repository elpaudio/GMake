# GMake
Simple yet powerful tool, CMake but for GameMaker, built in GameMaker itself!

This repo contains source code of GMake, and GMakeLists.txt for compiling GMake.

GMake has a little amount of functions now but more will be added soon.

Better add GMake folder to environment variables to compile any gamemaker project 
without creating links to GMake executable or copying it to your game folder.

## FEATURES
- can add /* comments */ to the code;
- can use other GameMaker functions, just type them in into your `GMakeLists.txt` file;
- more is coming soon...
